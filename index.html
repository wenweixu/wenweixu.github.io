      <h2>Dying orphan puppies ? Noooo !</h2>
      <article>
        Captain Picard loves puppies. Unfortunately there are too many orphans puppies and kittens in our streets. That's not cool. If they don't have humans to care for them, they die.
        <h3>Spay... the Final Frontier</h3>
        <p>Spaying and neutering is an easy way to fix the problem in all the federation. Do it already! If you are unsure about the procedure, go check out <a href="spay_and_neutering.html">spaying and neutering</a></p>
        <p>spaying and neutering is a great example of how we can all follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive">Prime Directive</a>. It's a good thing! Even Kirk thinks so ! "A starship captain's most solemn oath is that he will give his life, even his entire crew, rather than violate the Prime Directive."
        <p>That's deep stuff. Think of the puppies.</p>

        <h3>Birth control ? Yes please.</h3>
        <p>Unwanted pregnancies for a dog or a cat not only have high associated costs for termination or prenatal care and puppy/kitty placement, they can also make your dog or cat miserable and at risk for complications. Please don't do that to them.</p>
        <p>If you are ready to make an appointment to get your dog or cat some birth control, check our <a href="resources.html">resource page</a>.</p>
